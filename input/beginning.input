[ THE PREDICATIVE MURDERER
&
[ And so it begins...
&
A murder has been committed at House Negonoform and you, inspector Ash, have been summoned. Who killed Lord R. Black, where did it happen and what weapon did they use?
Only you can find out. 
&
A pale looking servant opens the door and leads you to the living room. Three suspects are present, all of them heirs of the late Lord R. Black. 
- First of all reverend F. Green, a longtime friend of Lord Black and leader of his local parrish.
- Then there’s also Colonel N. Mustard, Lord Black’s cousin just back from the colonies.
- Lastly there’s C. Scarlet, an artist under Lord Black’s patronage. Lord Black left her a small sum to live from after he’d die. 
&
But no, you can’t talk to them yet. Before you speak to the suspects you have to check out the possible weapons first.
