[ CHAPTER 1
[ What was the murder committed with?
&
Inside the house and in its surroundings, a few suspicious looking items have
been collected that could have possibly killed Lord Black. Mrs. White, Lord Black's 
servant, leads you to the kitchen. 

&
The items have been collected and put on the kitchen table for you to look at. You see three possible murder weapons.
- The first item that had been found, a long twisted rope, 
- The second item that could have been used to kill Lord Black was a broken vase.
- The third suspicious item that had been found was a jar containing a poisonous fluid.

You turn your attention to the long rope. Mrs. White tells you it was found laying on the floor near the basement entrance.

% ROPE
% Guilty:
- You: This rope looks quite new. However it has been used at least once before.
- Mrs. White: That could be very true you know. Until a few days ago, I had never seen this rope in the house before. It must've been bought very recently.
- You: Hmm, I wonder if that is a coincidence or not...
&
% Not guilty:
- You: This rope sure looks damaged. This must've been used at least a dozen times.
- Mrs. White: Oh, yes indeed. If I know one thing, its that Lord Black would often take this rope with him to his bedroom at night. I have no idea what he would use it for.
- You: Well, since the rope still has a few loops in it, this rope sure looks like it could have been used to strangle him to death.
&

You look over at the broken vase. This vase was made out of porcelain and its broken shards were found scattered around the living room, its original location.

% VASE
% Guilty:
- You: This vase looks very suspicious to say the least.
- Mrs. White: Well, you know… Lord Black has a cat that loves to hop on every shelf in this house. Maybe it was the cat that pushed over the vase. This isn't the first vase that clumsy cat has destroyed.
- You: I get what you're saying, but looking at the amount of shards, I feel like there was more force into play than just gravity.
&
% Not guilty:
- You: Hmm. I bet that if you use the right amount of force, a vase like this could definitely kill you if you're hit in the back of the head.
- Mrs. White: You do have a point inspector, however, this is not the first time a broken vase was found around the house. Lord Black's cat loves to jump on the shelves and push over all sorts of objects. This is the 3rd vase in about 2 months time.
- You: Do you really have time to keep track of such statistics?
- Mrs. White: Well, of course! I mean, I'm the one who has to clean up all the mess every time.
- You: Right.
&

You walk to the jar containing poisonous fluid. As you lean over to pick it up the scent makes you almost start to throw up.

% Poison
% Guilty:
- Mrs. White: Inspector, I found this jar myself, so if you start looking at fingerprints don't suspect me please!
- You: Hmm… And where did you find this exactly?
- Mrs. White: I was cleaning the kitchen when I smelled this really bad scent. When I started looking for where this scent could've come from, I found this jar at the very bottom of the trash can in the kitchen. It was near empty when I found it.
- You: Near empty you said? Who in their right mind would even use this in the first place?
- Mrs. White: Well, a few weeks ago there was a rat plague in this house. Thus, this poisonous fluid was used to get rid of the plague. It proved to be very effective!
- You: Maybe too effective… It could've been used to get rid of something..., or should I say someone, as well.
&
% Not guilty:
- You: Ugh, what is this smell?
- Mrs. White: This jar contains a poisonous fluid which was used to get rid of a rat plague we had a few weeks ago.
- You: I see, well there must've been a whole lot of rats then, since about a fourth of this jar is already empty.
- Mrs. White: Oh inspector, you don't even wanna know. It was hell. I'm so scared of those animal!
- You: I know the missing amount of poison can take care of a few rats. I wonder however, if this  amount could account for a human victim as wel...
