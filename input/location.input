Lord Black's body was found in a small pond near the garden.
Vague drag traces were left behind near the pond, meaning Lord Black was
most likely not killed outside, but somewhere close by.
&

There are only 3 spots where Lord Black could have been
killed without anyone noticing.
- The atelier in the garden.
- Inside the house itself.
- The church adjacent to the garden.

You will now visit these spots in order to investigate the crime scene.

% ATELIER
% Guilty:
- Ms. I. White: Lord Black is the only one that has access to the atelier along after 17:00. That's when the atelier closes.
- You: Did he have a reason to go there after closing time at all?
- Ms. I. White: Well, yes actually. He would often show around guests or friends in his free time. He was very passionate about all the art in here.
- You: Okay, very well. There is definitely a possibility that he was killed here when no one was around.
&
% Not guilty:
- You: Did Lord Black spend a lot of time in the atelier?
- Ms. I. White: Not really to be honest. As far as I'm concerned, he only has this atelier to show off and to make money off of it.
- You: So he barely even goes there if I am correct?
- Ms. I. White: Well, no. He does visit it quite a bit. However, he is not actually there to worship the art.

You go investigate inside the house.

% HOUSE
% Guilty:
- You: Besides Lord Black, who else lives here?
- Ms. I. White: Only Lord Black, and his young daughter.
- You: So am I correct to assume that Lord Black is often home alone when his daughter is at school?
- Ms. I. White: Yes indeed inspector, when she is at school, unless he has visitors, he is the only one in the house along with me.
- You: So then, where were you when the murder happened?
- Ms. I. White: I was outside taking care of the garden.

- Ms. I. White: I was actually inside as well. I mean, I am getting older but even though I was on the other side of the mansion, I do believe I would've heard some suspicious sounds if the murder took place here.
- You: Very well...

% CHURCH
% Guilty:
- You: Ms. I. White, I have a question for you.
- Ms. I. White: Yes inspector, what's the matter?
- You: I wonder how frequently, Lord Black went to the church, do you know that perhaps?
- Ms. I. White: He would usually go 3 days a week. However, I have noticed that for the past week, he's been staying there longer than he normally does.
- You: Ah, right. So he was quite the religious guy wasn't he?
- Ms. I. White: Yes indeed. He is often one of the last few people to leave the church. So by the time he leaves, it is often quite uneventful in there.

% Not guilty:
- You: Ms. I. White, I have a question for you.
- Ms. I. White: Yes inspector, what's the matter?
- You: Would Lord Black visit the church often or not?
- Ms. I. White: He would visit church from time to time, however, he wouldn't spend a lot of time in there. When he was there he was usually there to accompany his grandchildren.
