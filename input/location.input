[ CHAPTER 2
[ Where did it happen?
&
Lord Black's body was found in a small pond near the garden.
Vague drag traces were left behind near the pond, meaning Lord Black was
most likely not killed outside, but somewhere close by. You know all three suspects claimed to be in one of the three locations surrounding the garden at the time of the murder,
but as they're all so close to each other you can't guarantee the location of any of them.
&

There are only 3 spots where Lord Black could have been
killed without anyone noticing.
- The atelier in the garden.
- Inside the house itself.
- The church adjacent to the garden.

You will now visit these spots in order to investigate the crime scene.
&

Which spot will you investigate?
* The atelier in the garden
ju 1
* Inside the house itself
ju 5
* The church adjacent to the garden
ju 9
* I don't need to investigate the locations, I know where he was killed.

% ATELIER
% Guilty:
- Mrs. White: Lord Black is the only one that has access to the atelier after 17:00. That's when the atelier closes.
- You: Did he have a reason to go there after closing time?
- Mrs. White: Well, yes actually. He would often show around guests or friends in his free time. He was very passionate about all the art in here. In fact I think I heard him mention wanting to give someone a tour last week...
- You: Okay, very well. So he might have been guiding around someone he knewe.
&
% Not guilty:
- You: Did Lord Black spend a lot of time in the atelier?
- Mrs. White: Not really to be honest. As far as I'm concerned, he only has this atelier to show off and to make money off of it. It belongs to Ms. Scarlet most of the time.
- You: So he barely even goes there if I am correct?
- Mrs. White: Why would he? He let Ms. Scarlet work there for a reason.
&

You go investigate inside the house.

% HOUSE
% Guilty:
- You: Besides Lord Black, who else lives here?
- Mrs. White: Only Lord Black, but his cousin Colonel Mustard is staying with him for a while.
- You: Colonel Mustard claims to have been at the church at the time of the murder.
- Mrs. White: Yes, and I was doing groceries in the village. The grocery clerk confirmed that, right?
- You: Yes. What did Lord Black usually do when he was alone? 
- Mrs. White: Well, work Sir. I see no reason why he would have been anywhere but in his study.

% Not guilty:
- You: Besides Lord Black, who else lives here?
- Mrs. White: Only Lord Black, but his cousin Colonel Mustard is staying with him for a while.
- You: Colonel Mustard claims to have been at the church at the time of the murder. Where were you again?
- Mrs. White: Upstairs, cleaning. I assumed Lord Black would've gone to his office in town.
- You: He was not in the house you mean?
- Mrs. White: No, as far as I know not. Of course he might have been downstairs...
&

You cross the garden to visit the church.
