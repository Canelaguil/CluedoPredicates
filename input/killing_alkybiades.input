Welcome to Sparta. You're preparing for a nice and cosy holiday at home when a messenger appears, telling you the great Senemis is looking for a misthios. That isn't someone you can say no to, so you reluctantly go to his house.

Senemis is an old man, with a bitter expression on his face. He receives you in the hall of his house. 
- Senemis: Ah, there you are. You are the misthios they call Eagle Bearer, wasn't it? What is your name?
